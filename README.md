Magick Meditator

bot.py is a discord bot version

Beeps come from freesound.org and were edited in Shotcut.

Pretty simple so far, the final version will be a GUI app for Desktop and Android.  I am using beeware.org to package the app.


//---tkmmpg.py--//

Tkinter but uses pygame instead of playsound to play audio.  Having trouble getting playsound to work in beeware


//---tkmm.py---//
 
Tkinter gui version, touchscreen friendly.

TO DO: find way to stop the loop immediately upon clicking reset or exit instead of having to wait for the loop to stop.
